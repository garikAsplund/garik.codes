No, don't do that. Rust is a peculiar language with a steep learning curve that is really great in certain scenarios. **But which scenarios?**

## Speed

## Security

## Stability

- what it is
- history of

Recently I applied to a startup that says they want to integrate ML and AI with healthcare. They're based in NY and seem like they mean business. But here's the thing, they want a back end built with Flask, and that is a terrible idea. Maybe that was okay like a decade ago, but we know better now. Flask will be terribly slow and have security vulnerabilities. The alternative is to have a back end written in Rust because it offers speed, security, and stability.
