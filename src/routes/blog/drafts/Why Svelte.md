## Simplicity > Popularity

When it comes to JavaScript <del>frameworks</del> libraries, **React** is king. It has the biggest user base as well as the most tools and trinkets to trick out any and every project.

However, it's 2023 and React is **bloated, complicated, and slow**.

That's not really a secret, and it feels like over the last few years React has become a punching bag. Fortunately, there are other--[arguably too many](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2023/table_chrome_116.0.5845.82.html)--frameworks and libraries that are seeking solutions. Some of these solutions are super slick, others not so much. Frameworks written in Rust, like Yew, can be just as bad as React. Others, not written in TypeScript, like Solid, *kill* when it comes to speed.

**Svelte, and now SvelteKit**, are the perfect alternative because they blend so many good qualities into one system. Here's why it's such a good choice:

- unrivaled DX
- small bundle sizes
- straightforward state management
- amazing performance and adaptability
- good and growing community support

Svelte came about in 2016 as the brainchild of Richard Harris

Rich Harris, and now the dedicated team at Vercel, have thought through how to provide an

## Good and growing community support

While Svelte may not be the most popular, it is the most loved. Its ecosystem of libraries and packages is well-maintained and growing by the day. With the recent official release of SvelteKit, it's super easy to build larger, more complicated projects, and this is where the magic of Svelte really kicks in.

We've all seen this side by side for creating a counter:

```react
code here
```

```svelte
code here
```

Svelte 4 just dropped with the understanding that it's just a prelude to Svelte 5. Recently Rich [teased](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1688581184018583558) how great Svelte 5 is going to be. The code runs about as close as you can get to vanilla JS, and he hinted that the features are gonna be what sets it even farther apart from the rest of the field. [And others agree.](https://twitter.com/spences10/status/1690712491708252160)

But who knows, maybe this is all for not and Astro will kick so much ass that in a month I'll be writing about *it* instead.

And don't even mention HTMX. Don't. Even.
