# Simplicity > Popularity

When it comes to JavaScript <del>frameworks</del> libraries, **React** is king. It has the biggest user base as well as the most tools and trinkets to bespoke any and every project. However, it's 2023 and React is **bloated, complicated, and slow**.

That's not really a secret, and it feels like over the last few years React has become a punchingbag. Fortunately, there are other--arguably too many--frameworks and libraries that are seeking solutions. 

**Svelte** is a perfect alternative because it has
- unrivaled DX
- small bundle sizes
- amazing performance
- good and growing community support

Rich Harris, and now the dedicated team at Vercel, have thought through how to provide both an amazing DX and fast endproduct.

## Unrivaled DX

## Small bundle sizes

## Amazing performance

## Good and growing community support

While Svelte may not be the most popular, it is the most loved. Its ecosystem of libraries and packages is well-maintained and growing by the day. With the recent official release of SvelteKit, it's super easy to build larger, more complicated projects, and this is where the magic of Svelte really kicks in.

We've all seen this side by side for creating a counter:

```react

```svelte
