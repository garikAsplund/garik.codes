This post is a response and riff on [ThePrimeagen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL88IAxoYOk) about why he feels bad for n00bs in the software game. 

**TL;DR it's a complex world out there and it's getting more complicated every day**.

## The OG Singularity

In the beginning everything was just one big mystery, one infinitesimally small point that contained it all. **The singularity**. No, not *that* singularity.

But since then, to put it simply, things have evolved. Out of the primordial ooze, we now have protons and neutrons and electrons, atoms, molecules, proteins, amino acids, DNA and RNA, cells, tissues, organisms, superorganisms, ecosystems, planets, solar systems, galaxies, galactic clusters, superclusters, and so on and so forth.

Much like the universe, computers have been increasing in complexity, creating and filling niches at breakneck speeds. First we had analog computers to tell us when the tides were coming and going. Pretty idyllic. Then we had electro-mechanical computers to help break the Enigma Code and defeat the Nazis. Pretty horrific. Then we had integrated circuits take us to the moon. Pretty futuristic.

Today, however, we have computers in our offices, in our homes, in our fridges, in our cars, in our pockets, in our bodies. Computers securely store our credit card information so we can shop at Safeway while stuck in traffic.  They help us pick the music we listen to, control the mood lighting from afar, and ***so much more***.

For us devs, what this means is we no longer have to be familiar with punch cards and machine code. Phew, that'd be scary! Instead, we have to know the Holy Trinity of HTML/CSS/JS, how to chose a framework and pick a database, how to containerize our app and deploy on the edge for maximum uptime and minimal latency. Bonus points if you can orchestrate your containers with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. We need to know DevOps lifecycle and what a CI/CD pipeline is. And that's just to get a simple website up and running.

## Too many targets

If you want to build an app these days, you have to know your target. Do you want:
    
    - A web app?
    - A mobile app?
    - A desktop app?
    - Some of the apps?
    - All of the apps?

 *actual app*, then you need to target both Android and iOS--so now you're writing in Kotlin or Dart for Google products and Swift for Apple products. Or maybe you want a desktop program, so you could use Electron to transpose a React-like project from the web. Then you have people trying to simplify all of this so you can just write once and deploy everywhere. In Rust there's a neat project, [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/]), doing just that. But, this is still *adding complexity* to the overall development environment! And there's no end in sight.

## Carrying technical debt
    
    - Cobal and fortran
    - React
    - Redisigning JS-- tale of JSON guy
    - WASM
    - C, C++, C#
    - Rust, Lobster
    - Zig, etc etc etc

## The irony of it all

The funny thing is, 99.99% of people will have no idea that there was such underlying complexity messes just to send a cat pic to your friend. Really, all the end user cares about is if something works. Can you send cat videos or not?
