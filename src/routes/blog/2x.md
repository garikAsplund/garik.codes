## Pro tip

I watch a ton of videos for research purposes.

It truly is amazing the access a layperson now has to experts from any field. Almost all conferences are fully recorded and available for free. ðŸ¤¯

But the worst part about watching so much content, however, is it's a major time suck. âŒ›

**Unless you set your playback speed to 2x!**

## Listen up

I've found that I don't really lose much info by doing that, and it actually makes me pay attention a little bit more because I'm trying to listen to it all.

During a regular talk there is enough dead space that I tend to start opening other tabs and read some vaguely related material. In short, it is easy to get distracted. So speeding things up increases my retention by *lowering my distractability*.

Plus, obviously, it cuts the time I spend watching a video in half.
